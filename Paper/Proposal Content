Alcohol sales based on climate conditions

Alcohol has been an integral part of cultures across the globe for many centuries. The consumption of alcohol occurs either during specific occasions like a wedding, a funeral, a birthday etc. or in a casual setting where freinds and family get together and have a couple of drinks. This study will attempt to find if in addition to the above mentioned events do any climatic factors affect the drinking pattern in people. The goal of this study is to try to find a pattern in the drinking habits of people [with focus on climate]. This study can prove to be a stepping stone for other alcohol consumption related studies such as 'Mishaps due to alcohol consumption', 'Health related issues due to alcohol consumption', 'Study of alcohol consumption and domestic violence' etc.

Evaluation Methods (10%. Max 100 words. Brief description of proposed methods  to evaluate chosen machine learning method)

Regression:
MSE/RMSE
MAE
